# The Lore Store (Backend)
The Lore Store is an online bookstore, this repository holds the code for the backend of the same. Here, is the [frontend repository](https://github.com/dhirajksharma/thelorestore-frontend) for the project. I have used **Express.js** for the server with **MongoDB** as my database program and **Mongoose** is my preferred choice of ODM.
